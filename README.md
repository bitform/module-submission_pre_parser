## module-submission_pre_parser

The Submission Pre-Parser module provides you with a simple UI to add your own PHP to examine and change the incoming POST data, before it gets added to the database. The module is actually just a visual wrapper for three Form Tools hooks: the ones that get executed in the ft_process_form, ft_api_process_form and ft_update_submission functions. These are the three main submission insert and update functions.
